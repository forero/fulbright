\title{Pushing the Limits of Dark Energy Experiments}
\begin{document}
\maketitle
\section*{Background}
\textit{Introduce the research topic. Place the project in academic or
professional context by referring to major works by others on the
subject. }

Understanding the accelerated expansion of the Universe is one of the
most important unsolved problems in fundamental physics.  
This was recognized by the 2011 Nobel Prize on Physics to three
astronomers who lead research teams that found observational evidence for
this phenomenon.  A complete understanding of the accelerated
expansion lies either on a new kind of negative pressure energy
component (dubbed under the generic name of Dark Energy) or in the
modification of Einstein's General Relativity. 

The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) is a world-class
experiment that is designed to bring the most significant experimental
advance on this front. 
DESI will take the spectra of 35 million galaxies to make the most
accurate measurement of the expansion history of the Universe on the
timescale 2019-2024 using the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation technique.  

One of the significant milestones to prepare DESI operations is a
full simulation of its expected five years of operations.
This simulation will allow to stress-test all the software that will
be used on the real data and also identify in advance strategies to
maximize DESI's scientific return.  
The results will be useful for the broad scientific community
expecting to use DESI data products.

The work to simulate such a complex experiment integrates the knowledge of
different groups of experts \cite{2016A&C....15....1N}. From the
engineers designing   the instrument, to the astronomers processing
the data, including the expert simulators of universes and
galaxies. This is a process I have been involved with during the last
two years by writing software and curating input data.
After the simulation is completed by mid 2017, I will join the effort
to analyze the resulting data.

 
This work will allows us to understand how close we are to answering
one of the most fundamentals questions about Science and Nature. What
will be the power of DESI to decide whether Einstein's General
Relativity is correct?  
Perhaps more exciting is that this would be our first step into the
unknown with DESI. What do we need to do to take the experiment beyond its
original design limits? Where are exactly DESI's power and limits for
discovery?

\section*{Objectives}
% Objectives: 
\textit{Clearly define the aims of the project.}

The main objective is to analyze the data resulting from a simulation
of five years of DESI operations.  

This will allow us to reach three goals:
\begin{itemize}
\item Forecast with great detail the accuracy at which the Dark Energy
  Spectroscopic Instrument will be able to constraint the expansion
  history of the Universe.  
\item Quantify the degree to which different instrumental systematic
  errors can degrade the experiment's performance.
\item Test strategies to mitigate systematic effects and maximize
  DESI's scientific return.
\end{itemize}


\section*{Methodology}
\textit{Methodology: Describe the project. Explain the approach, methods and
plan you will use (for example, interviews, library or archival
research, or laboratory experiments). Indicate whether the proposed
research is quantitative or qualitative. }


This project aims at quantifying the expected performance of the DESI
experiment. 
This requiere an end-to-end simulation of the DESI survey including:
\begin{itemize}
\item generating mock catalogs for the galaxy populations to be
  observed.
\item simulations the 5 years of telescope operations including
  weather and observational cadence.
\item assigning optical fibers to the targets.
\item generating simulations of the raw spectrograph data.
\item processing those simulated data with the full spectroscopic
  pipeline, resulting in a redshift catalog.
\item tracing efficiencies to generate a large scale structure
  catalog.
\end{itemize}

This will allow the DESI project 
\begin{itemize}
\item Test interfaces and dataflow.
\item Test software scaling.
\item Generate realistic datasets for science prepration before the
  survey starts.
\end{itemize}

The current project takes a starting point the realistic datasets for
science preparation. 

\section*{Significance}
\textit{Significance: Explain the importance of the project for the field,
your home country and your own professional development. Indicate
what effect you expect the opportunity to have on your teaching or
professional work in your home country. (For example: new approaches
to curriculum planning, student advising or pedagogy; expanding
knowledge in the field through collaboration with
U.S. colleagues). Describe briefly the expected impact of your
participation on your home institution, community or professional
field. }

%Importance to the international community.
DESI is a world-class experiment in the area of observational
cosmology. 
This imposes a high threshold on the require quality for the
simulation and data products available to the collaboration. 



%Importance to the Colombian community.
This collaboration can also enrich the colombian scientific
community.

%Importance to my research.

%Impact on my teaching.

%Importance to the Astronomy for Development community.

I also act as a coordinator in the Astronomy for Development (AfD)
initiative. The AfD was started by the International Astronomical
Union as a result of the international year for astronomy in 2009.
The high level goal is to use astronomy to create a better world. 
This is achieved by implementing projects that use the cultural,
technical and scientific aspects of astronomy to engage with local
communities and impact their development status. 

I will also use my time at LBL to create new partnerships to achieve
the AfD golas. In particular I will contacti LBL scientists interested in
teaching in summer schools for students in the Anean Region. I will
also engage with scientists and professionals working in the science
museum to contact them with people working in local musesms to
exchange ideas about best practices. We in the Andean Region are also
developing work to make outreach material useful for people with
disabilities. 



\section*{Evaluation and Dissemination}
\textit{Evaluation and Dissemination: Describe plans for assessment and
distribution of research results in your home country and elsewhere.}


%Assessment by the collaboration leaders. 
DESI has a formal project management structure. This specifies milestones
and deadlines for the different tasks defined in the current
proposal. The internal assesment process by the managers in the
collaboration provides a natural strategy to asses the project
progress. 

% osfware contribution
The software contributions done in this project will be publicly
available through the public DESI repository. 


%Publications by the collaboration.
Scientific publications are also a natural outcome. The analysis of the
data challenge results are of interest to the wide scientific
community. As such we will publish in astronomical journals of wide
international circulation.

% presentation results.
%Presentation in the collaboration meeting.
%Presentations in the Colombian Congress of Astronomy. 
The project results will also be presented in scientific meetings. Thr
first natural venues is the internal collaboration meetings. Also to
enahce the impact in the colombian astronomical community, I will also 
present the results in the Colombian Congress of Astrophysics to take
place in 2018.  




\section*{Justification}
\textit{Justification for Residence in the United States for the Proposed
Project: Indicate why it is necessary to conduct the research on site
 in the United States. }

DESI is coordinated by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The
collaboration includes close to 300 scientists in 40 institutions
around the world. 
Most of the simulation work is done in different locations (including
Bogota) and it is coordinated via virtual meetings.  
However, to consolidate progress (i.e. by releasing software or data
to the collaboration) it is crucial to spend a minimal amount of time
in face-to-face meetings. 

Since 2014 I have used funding from my University and the DESI
collaborationn to spend at least one week per semester at
Berkeley Lab writing and integrating sofware for the data simulation
pipeline. 
As DESI gets closer to starting operations in January 2019, the
experiment has reached a point where the end-to-end simulation effort
has matured and gained relevance to the operational aspects of the
project. 

A significant and timely contribution to DESI needs the focused effort on
site at Berkeley Lab that a Fulbright fellowship can best provide. 

\section*{Duration}
\textit{ Duration: Explain how the project can be completed within the time
period proposed. }

I expect to spend a total of 16 weeks working on site at Berkeley
Lab starting mid August 2017 through December 2017. 

Currently we are working on the preparation of the full simulation
(August-December 2016) and the associated analysis tools. We will
perform the simulation next year (January-July 2017) and complete the
analysis in the period August-December 2017.  

The analysis stage will be the focus of my visit
to Berkeley Lab.
We foresee four stages, each one fitting into a 4-week period.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Measure the accuracy at which the simulated data constrains the
  expansion history of the Universe.  
\item Quantify different instrumental systematic errors can degrade
  the experiment's performance. The focus will be on the effect of
  fiber assignment and success of the spectroscopic pipeline. 
\item Run simplified simulations to test strategies that mitigate
  systematic effects and maximize DESI's scientific return.
\item Consolidate a detailed report on the results from the end-to-end
  simulation challenge. 
  The full report is aimed at the DESI collaboration. A condensed
  version will be published for the broader scientific community
  interested in understanding the kind of data that the DESI
  collaboration will produce. 
\end{enumerate}

This tasks depend on software that we are constrained to develop in
the period August 2016 - July 2017. As the simulation runs we will
analyze small chunks of data to fine tune the required tools. 

The experience we gain in this one-year preparation period ensures that
focused work during 16 weeks, using mostly existing tools, is the only
critical step to succeed in the global analysis task.
