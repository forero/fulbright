## THE PROJECT STATEMENT
The project statement is the most important component of the Fulbright application. Scholars with the most compelling, theoretically sound, well-written, feasible proposals are generally
recommended for awards. Sometimes those with outstanding professional achievements assume that a brief, general project statement will be sufficient; it is not. To ensure a competitive
application, your proposed project, as well as the strategy for completing it, should be thoroughly explained in three to five single-sided pages.
Submit a detailed project statement of no more than five single-spaced pages (3,500 words).

## FORMAT
* Do not exceed the character limit of the proposal. Including irrelevant or extraneous material may divert
attention from the project statement.  
* Begin the project statement with your name, country and the project title at the top of page one.
At the top of each subsequent page, type your name and country.  
* Organize your proposal in order of the following points, which appear in bold print, and use 
them as headings for sections of text in your statement.
